### "When you become a leader your job is to define the problem. Not solve it"

I recently saw this quote floating around somewhere on the internet. I'm not sure who it was attributed to, but it summed up one of the first lessons I had to learn when I started managing people. Coincidentally, it also nicely sums up the first step in starting to think more strategically. 

We often find ourselves stuck trying to solve problems, whether it is in our personal lives or professional careers. Rarely do we stop to ask ourselves if we are solving the correct problem. Or if the "problem" we have to solve is even a real problem. Oftentimes, things we identify as problems are really symptoms of something else and when we "solve" the problem, we have only put a temporary band aid on it.

How do we start defining the real problems in life?
