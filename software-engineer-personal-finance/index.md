description: We often hear about how building effective systems will help us achieve our goals. But few people actually provide actionable ways to build a system.

## *"Fall in love with systems" -James Clear in Atomic Habits*
Read through any personal finance blog and eventually you will see some variation on this theme of building up a system that automates your savings and other financial activities. A lot of times the author will throw out a few products they use in their own life, but very few actually walk through what role these apps play in their own system. Even less actually lay out what that system looks like.

Yes, everyone should have some sort of written out budget detailing where they plan on spending their money every month. They should do a review at the end of the month to tell them how they actually spent their money. They should push a portion of their paychecks into a savings account automatically so they never see that money. All of these things are key to systematically build your personal wealth over time. And there are a lot of handy apps out there that will do a lot of this for you.

Over the next few months I plan on doing a series of articles breaking down a personal finance system that anyone can use to help improve their own position. A few items I want to walk through and cover are:
* Designing your own system
* Identifying areas you can automate

As a software engineer, I love systems and automation. I have worked to bring this mindset to my own finances and have recently started seeing some pay off from this. I am by no means perfect, I've made plenty of mistakes in my own financial life, but from these mistakes I was able to take away some key lessons and improve my own position.
