I’ll be the first to admit, I wasn’t the greatest project manager but I was effective in getting work done. I knew how to effectively leverage all members of a team to ensure a project was successful. I thought I was ready to go be a kick ass manager and prove to other people they were wrong to doubt my abilities. I remember the day the offer came in, I had left work early to go take a test for a class I was taking, Foundations of Mathematical Proofs (yes I am that person who takes math courses for fun). When I saw the email the next morning, I was shocked. Here was the opportunity I had been waiting for. </p>\n<p>Fast forward a few months after I showed up and started, I was totally unprepared for the shift in responsbilities. As a project manager, I was used to having well defined and measurable daily/weekly/monthly goals I had to meet. This new world of efficiently managing resources assigned to me was so foreign. The breadth of everything I was responsible for was incredibly overwhelming. I had no idea what I was doing.</p>\n<p>Two years later, I was recognized as the Davis-Monthan AFB Senior Civilian of the Year, an award given to the most impactful civilian on the installation for a given year. Going from an overwhelmed slacker to an overly ambitious high achiever was a great transformation. I am not solely responsible for these achievements, there were a lot of external factors that helped, from an incredibly supportive boss to the incredibly talented teams I was lucky to work with. But there was also a big internal shift within myself that helped me.</p>\n<p>Learning how to lead, learning how to build lasting relationships and learning to understand an organizations mission statement are all key skills I had to pick up. Throughout this journey, I gained a deeper understanding of my own inherent strengths and weaknesses and I am attempting to document some of these here. Some day I will write those stories down and share the lessons. Today I just wanted to highlight the power of betting on yourself.</p>\n<p>When you are willing to take a big risk based solely on your own belief in yourself, you are creating an opportunity for massive success. In most cases, even if you fail, the experience you will have gained puts you so far ahead of where you would have been, it becomes a win anyway. What is something you are afraid of doing right now? Why don’t you use that fear as a signal of what you should be moving towards?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Be Willing to Bet on Yourself","date":"October 03, 2019","description":"Anytime life hands us a big risk, our first inclincation is to shrink away from it. We want to stay where we know its safe and not shake anything up. But our greatest success will often come on the other side of a great risk. The next time life poses a great risk, bet on yourself."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/bet-on-yourself/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/wpengine-ceo-talk/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Conversation with Heather Brunner, WPEngine CEO"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/career-framing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Own Your Career"}}}}}
