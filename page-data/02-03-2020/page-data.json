Rebuilt those VM’s when the cluster installation failed. I am realizing I need to learn more about how OpenShift installs to better understand what is going on and how to troubleshoot failed installs. There are so many networking pieces that I feel clueless about.</li>\n<li>I purchased my first Raspberry Pi over the weekend to play around with. I’ve found a few tutorials for turning it into a router as well as setting it up as a TOR gateway and I want to play around with that. I need to explore what else I can build with it and have some fun. I’m really getting back into exploring more of my nerdy interests and it feels pretty good.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Topic I’ve been curious about lately</h3>\n<p>Something that I have been diving into with work and in my spare time lately is digging into network infrastructure stuff. More on the software side of networking than hardware, so working to better understand DHCP, DNS, the OSI 7 Layer model and how all of these pieces interact together to create what we all know as the internet.</p>\n<p>On a related note, I’ve been thinking about how we tend to abstract out the complexities of our modern lives. Few people ever think about how the technology they use every day actually works. In this case, I am focused on the internet. So many people take advantage of the fact that it is available at their fingertips. Yet, we never actively think about where that information we are putting out actually goes. Who’s listening in on our digital conversations? What can they learn about us just from that?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"February 3 Thoughts","date":"February 03, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-03-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-06-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"February 3 Thoughts"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-04-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Log: February 4, 2020"}}}}}
