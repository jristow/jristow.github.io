I don’t know about anyone else, but this year has felt incredibly long. Part of that has to do with all of the life changes I went through, but still, I feel like I should be headed into 2022 not 2020. With everything that has happened this year, I am going to separate things into professional and personal categories and probably put some sub-categories in these as well. Let’s start with the professional changes.</p>\n<h3>Professional</h3>\n<p>To start this year, I learned I had won two major awards for my work with the Air Force during 2018. While I never set out to get this type of recognition, it was exciting to see my work recognized. Ironically, shortly after these awards were announced, I put in my resignation paperwork to move into a different career. </p>\n<p>That move was accepting a software engineer role at Charles Schwab, where I would work on modernizing one of their applications. This was a short lived role, as I realized I needed more of a customer outcome focus in my work. Which lead me to IBM where I am currently a Cloud Developer focused on partnering with customers to create successful adoptions of our technology.</p>\n<p>The biggest lesson I learned from this career changing is that I really enjoy partnering with customers to solve problems they have. Having this clarity will help me as I grow my professional career.</p>\n<p>Not really a professional thing yet, but I did start publishing my thoughts and advice here on this site. I would like to grow this into some sort of income producing project eventually, but I am not sure what that may look like yet.</p>\n<h3>Personal</h3>\n<p>On the personal front, I moved from Arizona to Austin which has been a really great change of scenery for me. I’ve built a lot of new relationships here and it has drastically improved my overall happiness. Long term, I’m not sure I see myself being here permanently, but it will work for now.</p>\n<p>After a few years of neglecting the dating part of my life, I have made it a point to put more energy into finding someone to build a relationship with. This was definitely something I’ve struggle with in the past and continues to be a work in progress.</p>\n<p>On other personal achievements, I was able to reach a milestone I have been striving towards for a few years: paying off my car! This step puts me closer to being debt free, leaving just my student loans to pay off. The freedom that comes from not owing anyone money is incredible.</p>\n<p>I read a lot of books this year, but beyond that I have started to learn how to read books. For too long I focused on reading for entertainment, not gaining knowledge. 2019 was the year I started to change that. My goal for 2020 is to use this space to share what I have learned from reading, which means I need to change how I read.</p>\n<p>I think these are really the highlights of 2019. If you’ve been following along, I appreciate it. I’ll see you in the new year!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Look Back at 2019","date":"December 24, 2019","description":"2019 was a big year for me personally.
