Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it <a href=\"https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840\">here</a>). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.</em></p>\n<p>This first discussion is focused on differentiating between wealth, money and status. Often people tend to mix these three up and view them as interchangable. Obviously someone who attends high status social events will be wealthy and have a lot of money. Instead of just applying that blanket thought to all three, we should actually look at what each one really is. Naval provides a great definition for each of these:</p>\n<p><strong>Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Money is how we transfer wealth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Status is your rank in the social hierarchy.</strong></p>\n<p>The conversation around these concepts is very good and I would encourage you to listen to the full recording, it’s only six minutes long. But today I want to just highlight a few take aways I had and then provide a few ways I plan on putting these concepts into practice.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>Focus on creating wealth, instead of getting caught up in the typical status games people play. Status games are inherently zero-sum games which means there will be a winner and a loser. Focusing on these games will satisfy our baser instincts, but will rarely have material impacts on our ability to achieve freedom.</p>\n<p>Money is a wealth transfer based on the time we put into something. When we create wealth for ourselves, we are buying back time to spend on things we are interested in.</p>\n<p>We can classify a lot of the keeping up with the Joneses and FOMO spending as status seeking behavior. We all want the nice car or house to signal to the world we are doing “well” at the career/economic game.  </p>\n<h3>Action Items</h3>\n<p><strong>Build something of my own.</strong> I have had an itch to create my own business for a while, but I never knew what to do. I need to make a leap and try something, even if it is a simple coaching side hustle.</p>\n<p><strong>Increase investment.</strong> Over the past few years I have been slowly increasing the portion of my income I dedicate to investment. I need to ramp that up even more now.</p>\n<p><strong>Remove status from my value equations.</strong> It doesn’t matter what type of car I drive or what the size of my house/apartment is. I am not trying to be better than anyone else based on the material posessions I own.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status - My Thoughts","date":"June 15, 2019","description":"Confusing money and status with wealth gives people the wrong incentives in their life."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/seek-wealth/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Who is Jordan Ristow?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/create-abundance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Make Abundance for the World - My Thoughts"}}}}}
