Which was a pretty interesting place, I had very little knowledge of what LBJ accomplished throughout his career in politics and it was eye opening to see everything he had a hand in. A lot of the same issues we are dealing with today on voter suppression and equal rights were spearheaded by him. I remember learning about him in history class but came away thinking he didn’t do much as president, so it was neat to learn about all of his accomplishments. The parents leave in the morning, but this was a good weekend spent with them. It feels good to be able to give them gifts like this, they sacrificed so much to help put me in better situations than they had.</p>\n<h3>Random thoughts on my mind</h3>\n<p>I set up my phone to limit my ability to access social media between 10 pm and 7 am this weekend. I’m trying to cut back on time spent “living” outside of my present location and life situations. I’ve noticed I start questioning a lot of my life when I dive too deep into Instagram and Twitter. It can really be a detriment to overall life satisfaction and happiness.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 8","date":"February 08, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-09-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-07-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 7"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-08-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 8"}}}}}
