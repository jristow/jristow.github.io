Whenever you wanted to talk to them, they would “multi-task” by checking email, writing a response, etc.</p>\n<p>The first manager I had out of undergrad was this way. Their office was set up so that the monitors sat in between the two of you, so anytime I would go in and talk with him I could always see his eyes also scanning what was on them. It was difficult to feel like what I was telling him was important.</p>\n<p>This experience had a huge influence on me as I grew in my career. When handed the opportunity to lead my own teams, I knew I had to work hard to make sure I didn’t fall into similar habits. As a manager and leader, it is easy to get caught up in the sheer amount of work that needs to get done. There are never enough hours in the day and you will never catch up on work. There is always more work that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>For me, I tried to make a habit of locking my computer screen when I needed to sit and talk with anyone. This prevented me from being tempted to scan whatever new email popped in. Or think about a memo I had to write. I disabled a lot of the notifications from my cell phone and even to this day I tend to keep it on night mode so notifications don’t show up. Anything I could do to try and be present in the moment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Being Present","date":"October 17, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/being-present/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/leader-vs-manager/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Leader vs. Manager"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bias/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fighting Your Biases"}}}}}
