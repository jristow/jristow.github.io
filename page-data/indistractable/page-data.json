Our phones are constantly lighting up with new notifications, letting us know that something incredible just happened and we need to know about it. Like right now! With all of this noise, it can sometimes be difficult to sit down and do focused work. Whether that’s writing, coding, reading or building your strategic plan, it is almost impossible to do with notifications drawing our attention away.</p>\n<p>There are a million articles out there telling you what you need to do to avoid these distractions. But usually, they are focused on what we, as humans, are doing wrong. We don’t have the willpower. Our attention spans have been destroyed by smartphones. All of these are identified as the problem, while leaving out the biggest key: the people designing our smartphones and applications design them to maximize the amount of time we devote to them!</p>\n<h3>How can we, as individuals, hope to beat back armies of designers and programmers whose sole purpose is to steal our attention?</h3>\n<p>The truth is, we are addicted to the dopamine spikes we get when we see someone liked our latest selfie. It’s just part of what drives us. But there is hope in how we can tackle this distraction overload that has gripped us. Nir Eyal, the man who literally wrote the book on how to keep attention on a product, has come out with his latest book <em>Indistractable</em>. The irony of the man who may be most responsible for our age of distraction putting out a book to combat that distraction is not lost on Nir, he acknowledges it in one of the first chapters.</p>\n<h3>How to become indistractable?!</h3>\n<p>Nir lays out what he calls his Indistractable Model, which is composed of four parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Master Internal triggers</li>\n<li>Hack Back External triggers</li>\n<li>Make Time for Traction</li>\n<li>Prevent Distraction</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Throughout the book he identifies actionable strategies on how to accomplish each of these four parts. One of my favorites was under mastering internal triggers, he talks about building out a daily schedule. His point being that we cannot say we are distracted, if we have not scheduled our time and identified something else we need to be doing.</p>\n<p>Contrary to all of the productivity articles out there, he does not try to demonize spending time on social media or e-mailing. His focus is more on being aware of what we are doing and why we are doing it. If we set aside time to scroll through social media, then it is not a distraction for us. If we reach for our phone to scroll through social media in a meeting, that is a sign of us trying to escape our current situation. It is all about being intentional with our time and attention.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to write up a whole synopsis of this book. Instead I would encourage you to go out and pick up a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34LSpvh\">copy</a>.
