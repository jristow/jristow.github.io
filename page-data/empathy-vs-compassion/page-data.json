That sounds like a good thing to have when you lead people. Being able to take a step back and understand when someone is feeling a certain way. However, a lot of the time when people talk about being empathetic they focus it on feeling what another person is feeling. When you try to do this as a leader you will quickly become overwhelmed by other peoples emotions.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Mind of the Leader</em>, the authors highlight emergency medical professionals who often suffer from emotional shut down after being exposed to a lot of very intense emotional circumstances. Imagine trying to take on the emotions and feelings of every trauma patient an ER nurse or doctor is exposed to day after day. As humans, we are not built to do that. Further, taking on the emotions and feelings of another person does nothing to help that other person. It’s like when the flight attendants tell you to put on your oxygen mask first in an emergency, if you try to help someone else first, you both may perish.</p>\n<p>Instead of building up your empathy for other people, the authors offer up compassion as an alternative. Compassion is defined as people going out of their way to help the physical, mental or emotional pains. That focus on helping is the key difference. When you approach a person with compassion, you are focusing on how to help them move forward instead of just sharing their pain with them. This is not easy to do as it requires you to be in control of your own emotions. This is a topic for a different day, but for today start looking at your own situations at work and explore whether you are responding with empathy or compassion. Stay tuned for a more in depth review of the book <em>The Mind of the Leader</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Empathy vs Compassion","date":"October 12, 2019","description":"We often hear about the need to be more empathetic towards people, especially within the context of being a leader. Doing an Amazon search for empathy and leadership returns over 400 books with those words somewhere in the title. It seems like maybe empathy is a superpower when it comes to leading people.
