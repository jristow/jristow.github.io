Getting a deeper understanding of how to install it, how the cluster builds itself and manages itself. I have been spending time on all of these. Today I focused mostly on working with a teammate to teach them how to install and build the cluster and we had a successful build which was nice. I also managed to build my own cluster finally, after a lot of frustration. Making sure environment variables are all filled out correctly is the biggest headache with OpenShift. But once things are set up correctly, the installation goes very smooth.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent the past few days working on writing up a basic network hardware description piece. I’m not 100% happy with it, but I am going to put it out anyway. I want to do some more writing on technologies underlying the internet as well. The next one will probably explore some of the protocols that run the network traffic through the internet.</p>\n<h3>Topic I’ve been curious about lately</h3>\n<p>One thing I want to start on is building a home cloud/file server with my raspberry pi. I’ve found a detailed write up on one which I plan on following soon. I may see if I can set up a git server on the raspberry pi as well. More to come on that though.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Log: February 5, 2020","date":"February 05, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-05-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-04-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Log: February 4, 2020"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/short-primer-internet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Short Primer on the Internet"}}}}}
