A lot of companies are moving to this type of model, as it allows employees and managers to be on the same page about expectations. Further, it makes it easier for individual contributors to understand how their role creates value for the overall organization. At first, I thought this program was just adding a lot of extra hoops we had to jump through to evaluate employees performance. Instead of being able to just check a box to say whether the employee was doing their job or not, we had to build out specific plans identifying our expectations for each employee.</p>\n<p>After implementing this system, I gained an appreciation and understanding of the value it can create. If managers and leaders don’t clearly lay out what is expected of contributors, if those contributors do not know how their work aligns with the organizations overall goals and objectives, there can be a disconnect with the individuals. How can a person know what is important to work on, if they don’t know what work of theirs is important to the organization?</p>\n<p>If your company doesn’t have a performance management system set up, or your manager doesn’t effectively utilize the one in place, sit down with them and have a conversation. Especially if you feel disengaged at work. Remember in school, the professors would provide a syllabus at the beginning of each semester, identify what work you were responsible for and how it would be assessed? This made it really easy for you to know where you were missing the mark and why. Performance management can be your syllabus in the professional world. Having these conversations ensures everyone is on the same page when it comes to performance and development. Managers won’t be blindsided by someone leaving their team, they will have a better understanding of when a person believes they are ready for a new role with more responsibility.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building Effective Organizations","date":"October 05, 2019","description":"Without defining measurable goals and objectives, it is impossible to determine if an organization is effective. On an individual level, not laying out what a manager expects from an employee prevents both parties from achieving peak effectiveness. Working as partners, managers and individual contributors can identify priorities and ensure they are a highly effective team."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/building-effective-organizations/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/career-framing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Own Your Career"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/motivation-or-dedication/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are You Motivated or Dedicated?"}}}}}
