When I heard this CEO speak earlier this week, she covered a lot of ideas some of which I was able to write down, others have just been coming back to me over the past few days. One of the ones that surfaced recently was something along the lines of owning and defining what your career story is. In her case, she realized early on most of her positions had been customer interfacing. So she totally owned it and branded herself as the customer expert in her company.</p>\n<p>This was really interesting to me as I have had a lot of trouble really telling the story of my own career, both as an internal dialog and on my resume. Our internal dialog is such a powerful force, yet so many people use it negatively. “I’m just a customer service representative.” Or “I only manage the projects.” Both of these can be reframed to show how you enable the customer to be successful. “I take care of any issues our customers have with the product.” Or “I work closely with customers to define their business problem and develop a solution to it.” Changing that internal narrative can help us see how we can be of service to others through our role.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when we have a clear definition of what we do and how we create value, we can easily explain why a role is a good fit for us. For me personally, this has definitely been something I have struggled with as I worked to grow my career. Early on, I simply saw myself as a project manager so I would highlight my project management skillset. But one of the key things I was missing is that as a project manager, I was the interface to our customer. I worked closely with them to understand their problems, I was the bridge between them and the technical team. Because I didn’t frame my experience in this way, it was difficult to understand how managing construction projects could translate into managing the project lifecycle of a new consumer electronic product.</p>\n<p>As you move into a leadership or management role, being able to do this also becomes necessary in order to build a cohesive team. When you can clearly articulate what value your team is creating or how they are creating positive outcomes for the organization or for others, you can start to see them buy into the work you are asking them to do. When I was building up the facility condition analytics function at my last position, I had to become an evangelist and preach to everyone how beneficial this change was going to be. How it was going to help our customers, how it was going to help other teams we worked with. As I did this, I could see everyone starting to buy in and we made a lot of progress with pushing these changes to the entire organization.</p>\n<p>The next time you are starting to question your work role, or have that negative internal dialog about your position, see if you can reframe what you do. Try to identify how you are being of service to others and see if that helps you gain perspective.
