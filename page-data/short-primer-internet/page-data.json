From the physical layer to the different protocols that allow traffic to flow across data connections, I will attempt to explain how this incredible tool works.</em></p>\n<h2>What makes up the Internet?</h2>\n<p>We all use this incredible tool everyday. From our cell phones to laptops to tablets, most of the world is always connected. But what exactly are we connected to? How does our Google search go from our phone off to Google so we can watch more cat videos? At it’s core, the internet is a network of networks. We can imagine this as the road networks we use everyday. There are streets in our neighborhood we use to go from house to house, a network of streets that expands beyond our house into our broader city and then a different network that connects our city to other cities across the country.</p>\n<p>To create this network of networks requires different physical devices. Switches, hubs and ethernet cables form the base of hardware we need to build a network. We use these when we create small home networks, or need to subdivide a larger internal network into small chunks. We can add wireless access points to this category as well, as these are used to eliminate the need for cables to add devices to our network. </p>\n<p>Moving from the small local network out into the wider network, we add routers. For most of us, we know routers as those little black boxes from the cable or telephone company that we plug into their line and it provides us internet access. Their primary purpose is to connect one isolated network with another larger network. When we want to reach a device outside our network, the router takes that request and forwards it to a different router that is one step closer to the destination.</p>\n<p>When we leverage technologies to help improve our lives, we should do our best to get a fundamental understanding of what that technology is doing under the hood. Today, we explored a little bit about technologies that power the internet. Hubs, switches, access points and routers all play an important role in moving our requests through networks. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Short Primer on the Internet","date":"February 05, 2020","description":"We all use the internet in our every day life, but how many of us know how it works?"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/short-primer-internet/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-05-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Log: February 5, 2020"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-06-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 6"}}}}}
