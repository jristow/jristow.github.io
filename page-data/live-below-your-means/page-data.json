Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it <a href=\"https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840\">here</a>). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.</em></p>\n<h3>The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary.</h3>\n<p>This post has a few things going on in it. Starting out, he talks about lifestyle upgrades and how people tend to upgrade their lifestyles too quickly. We get a raise at work and immediately look for how we can improve our life with that money. Usually, the thing that would improve our lives most, gets overlooked, and that is buying back part of your freedom. Instead, we look at upgrading the car or house. This happens slowly and we don’t really notice the changes while we are making them. But then one day, we’re making $100 an hour and still have no money left.</p>\n<p>This is probably the easiest trap we can fall into that prevents us from building true wealth. I know I am guilty of it, I  wound up buying three new cars in succession when I was younger. Each one a worse decision than the previous one. Luckily I have started moving past this behavior, but I still find myself wanting to upgrade my life as I grow in my career.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing he points out, that I had never thought about, is the ideal way to make a lot of money. If we slowly build up to a very high hourly rate, we still have a hard time accumulating money. However, if we were to instead have some immediate windfall, we wouldn’t have the problem of lifestyle creep. Obviously, we would want to make sure not to spend all of the money we just made, but making these discrete chunks of money usually leaves us better off than slow and steady buildups of hourly wage gains.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaway</h3>\n<p>For this post, I really want to focus on finding ways to just make discrete chunks of money instead of building up my hourly rate.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Live Below Your Means -- My Thoughts","date":"August 11, 2019","description":"Living below your means grants you a certain freedom that people who live at or above their means never experience.
