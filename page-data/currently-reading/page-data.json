I moved to Texas, started a new job and have been slowly getting settled in and exploring my new city. This has kind of put a damper on my energy and focus to write and put out new content. But, I am starting to feel more settled, so I plan on starting to make more time for writing and creating new content for the site.</p>\n<p>As part of this, I want to start highlighting some of the items I read each week that really open my eyes. You know, another generic weekly roundup type of blog post. However, I plan on including not only articles, but also books that I am reading and some background information on those books.</p>\n<p>I also plan on shifting the focus of the blog from the random software development/personal finance focus I have had to more of a critical thinking/decision analysis focus. I have been reading a lot in both of these areas lately and want to start writing things about them to help myself remember the topics, and if my writing benefits someone else out there then thats even better!</p>\n<p>Alright, enough catch up let’s talk about what I’ve been reading.</p>\n<h5>Blogs</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/\">Collaborative Fund</a>:\nSo this first one isn’t a particular post, but the overall blog over at Collaborative Fund always has some really interesting articles. Mostly focused on finance, but theres some good gems about overall decision making included.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/\">Calculated Risk</a>:\nI actually found this blog from Collaborative Fund, but it has a lot of really interesting economic data commentary. Not quite focused on decision making, but any decision requires facts to help guide it and he provides some incredible fact based analysis.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich/#more-28492840\">Naval on Wealth</a>:\nThis is more a series of blog posts and podcasts, which I started writing up key takeaways and action items from, but life got in the way. I may dive back into working on that again, or I may forget it. Either way, you should go read this entire series for yourself. Naval and team provide a lot of powerful takeaways to think about.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Books</h5>\n<p>So, a few of these are older ones but they still hold a lot of wisdom in them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Principles - Ray Dalio: This is one of the grails for helping make better decisions. He walks through a lot of algorithms anyone can employ to help make better decisions.</li>\n<li>Stumbling on Happiness - Daniel Gilbert: This is one I have had for a few years and never quite finished. But he walks through a lot of science behind happiness in people and why we are always wrong about what will make us most happy.</li>\n<li>The Art of Gathering - Priya Parker: This is an excellent discussion about our current problems with meetings and really any other gathering. She walks through great strategies to help improve your future gatherings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Podcast</h5>\n<p>I’m not a huge podcast person, but I did listen to a couple recently that had a lot of good points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/ramit-sethi-interview/\">Financial Independence</a>:\nThe Mad Fientist is a great resource for really streamlining your tax efficiency strategies. This podcast episode he has a very solid conversationn with Ramit Sethi about FIRE and other aspects of saving and spending money.</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/naval-ravikant\">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>:\nNormally, I’m not a Joe Rogan fan. But this episode with Naval was absolutely brilliant. Expanding on the series I posted in blogs, they do a deep dive on wealth creation in this episode.</p>\n<h3>That’s everything!</h3>\n<p>I feel like this is starting to get really long, so I’m going to wrap it up. Hopefully you check out some of these resources, if you do, please share how they have impacted you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Brief Catch Up & Currently Reading","date":"July 30, 2019","description":"After a short hiatus, I figured it was time to provide a brief update as to what has been going on in life and provide a brief list of some of the best things I've been reading lately."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/currently-reading/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/making-money-isnt-luck/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making Money isn't About Luck -- My Thoughts"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/radical-open-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making Better Decisions with a Radically Open Mind"}}}}}
