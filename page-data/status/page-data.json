I started thinking about this in the context of leading other people or being a leader. It can be easy, especially early in our careers, to view a management position as imbuing people with some elevated status. They were put in charge of people, so clearly they are better than those people. </p>\n<p>If we start looking at these positions in this light, it becomes less about maximizing the output of a collection of people, and more about elevating ourselves over our colleagues. This is where good teams start to become less effective. The status mindset is all about winners and losers. Who’s better than who.</p>\n<p>If you let this mindset take over, as a leader, your team will take note of it. Continuing to focus more on the outcomes of the team as a whole and empowering the individual members of your team to push themselves is the best path towards being known for building more effective teams.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Don't Seek Status.
