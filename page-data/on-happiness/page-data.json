This skill should help us to make decisions that will improve our future conditions, however, we often find people are no happier 3, 6, or even 9 months after they made a decision. There is a ton of research out there showing how, no matter what, humans tend to settle in around a 7 on their happiness scale. Yet, we all still worry about how our current decisions will affect our future happiness.</p>\n<p>To me, this is kind of an interesting phenomenom. We have such a disconnect between what we think will make us happy and what actually does make us happy, and we worry so much about our future happiness that we tend to sacrifice our current state of happiness for the shot at some future state of being more happy!</p>\n<p>What can we do to combat this? One thing I’ve been working on is focusing on being more present. When I simply focus on where I am at currently, I find myself worrying less. If we are just going to settle back in at a 7 level of happiness, why fight against it?</p>\n<p>This is easier said than done, I know. I still struggle in areas where I want to look at long term goals that I know will make me happier. When I find myself in those moments, I try to break that long term goal down into a daily habit that I can focus on. Shifting this long term view into a shorter term focus helps anchor you in the present moment. Instead of saying “I need to save $1000 by the end of this year” the conversation becomes “I need to put $2.75 in my savings account today.” Same effect, much less stress.</p>\n<p>Next time you find yourself focused on some far away point where you will be “happier” remember that you probably won’t actually be happier then. Focus on the current moment and work to improve your present position first.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Monday Morning Thoughts on Happiness","date":"December 09, 2019","description":"What makes a person happy?
