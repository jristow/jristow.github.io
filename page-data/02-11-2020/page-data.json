I have discovered I don’t really enjoy lecture based classes anymore. I would rather be given a problem and spend the lecture time learning on my own how to solve that problem. This tends to help me internalize the concepts I am learning a lot better.</p>\n<h3>Random thoughts of the day</h3>\n<p>How do we think algorithmically? What does that mean? How can we use the skill in life, outside of computer science? I think the power of algorithmic thinking is often overlooked when people talk about problem solving. Algorithms are nothing more than step by step instructions on how to solve a problem. Only after we translate them to computer code do they become anything more.</p>\n<p>The Socratic method of teaching seems to have fallen out of favor, but I still find it incredibly valuable as a tool for helping people learn. When you start to ask someone questions that help lead them to the answer, you can watch as they realize the understanding they already have of the material. It’s a pretty powerful experience.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 11","date":"February 11, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-11-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-10-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 10"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-12-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 12"}}}}}
