So I spent some time working this morning and then we went down to explore some of Zilker Park and Barton Springs pool. I always forget how many opportunities there are in this city for fun, active events. There were so many people out and about on the green belt and in the park while we wandered around, even on a Friday afternoon in February. I need to take advantage of these opportunities more often. Especially with Steve, he loves going out and being amongst the people.</p>\n<h3>Random thoughts from today</h3>\n<p>After hanging out down in that part of town, I kind of want to move closer to it. Get out of this north part of Austin and get closer to the outdoor opportunities right around downtown. With work being so flexible, this is the perfect opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p>Austin has definitely started to grow on me. After being unsure when I first moved here, I am realizing all of the amazing things that are available in this city that I would miss if I left.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 7","date":"February 07, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-07-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-06-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 6"}},"next":null}}}
