I spent a lot of time reading up on OpenShift and how it is supposed to self-install/self-build once you kick off the process. The overall process is pretty wild, you build out a single bootstrap node which essentially has configurations and installation binaries required to build the control-plane on three master nodes. There are a bunch of network requests sent back and forth between the nodes to get and create files and different resources. Eventually everything is supposed to come together and create the functioning cluster.</p>\n<p>I really want to dive deeper into it to get a better understanding of how this happens, because right now I am running into trouble and don’t know how to troubleshoot the process. Everything has been abstracted out to such a degree, my only option is to rebuild my cluster and try the install again if it doesn’t work.</p>\n<h3>Topic I’ve been curious about lately</h3>\n<p>I’m still pretty interested in exploring mnetworking with a Raspberry Pi. With family visiting this weekend, I probably won’t have a chance to play with it until next weekend. But I’m starting to pick out some projects I want to attempt once I do have time. One big one is building a home cloud/file server set up. Or using it to create a DMZ/honeypot outside of my internal network. We’ll see what else comes up.</p>\n<h3>Random thoughts I’ve had</h3>\n<p>Just thoughts about how complexity is prevalent in our lives, yet we don’t really recognize it. We have access to tools and technology that abstracts out much of the complexity in our lives. This is a blessing but also can be a curse.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 4","date":"February 04, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-04-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-03-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 3"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-05-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Log: February 5, 2020"}}}}}
