I got up to his post on how the internet has enabled people to scale their niche obsession and reach thousands of people with similar interests and it got me thinking on how I can better leverage what I am doing with my website. One topic that has been very interesting to me lately has been strategy and how people can use it in their life and careers. </p>\n<h5>Where did all of this strategy talk come from Jordan?</h5>\n<p>In my previous work position, I was put in charge of 30 people across three teams. I had no idea what to do or how to manage the chaos I had been dropped into. My first six months were a blur of reading everything I could find on what the goal of the department was as well as how to manage people. It was a similar situation to the one Shane Parrish from <a href=\"https://www.fs.blog\">fs.blog</a> wrote about <a href=\"https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/\">here</a>. I needed to learn about setting the vision for a whole department, along with ensuring that vision lined up with the overall vision of the organization. It was a tough spot to be in for someone who never planned to be in that position from the beginning (more on this in a future post).</p>\n<p>Thats the short version of what got me invested in learning strategic thinking and planning. After that initial shockwave, I realized this thinking could be applied to a lot of other areas in life and I started exploring different ways to apply it. It also led me to start reading everything I could find on strategy, including topics on game theory and old war strategy books. And now, after feeling lost with how to direct this website, I plan on presenting this information to you readers. If there are any topics you want to learn about, please reach out and let me know.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Strategy Project","date":"August 17, 2019","description":"After flitting from topic to topic without any discernible direction, I have decided to focus my writing on strategy and strategic thinking/planning.
