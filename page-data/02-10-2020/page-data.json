A lot of this is review, after spending the past month immersed in building out several Kubernetes clusters. Learning and refreshing on Docker was actually pretty useful, it’s been awhile since I really used it and we covered multistage builds, which was pretty neat. </p>\n<p>I did find a pretty neat project where people have built kubernetes clusters running on Raspberry pi’s, which is something I am really interested in. We also briefly discussed the networking aspect of kubernetes, which I’m excited to dive into a little more. Understanding the world of networking has become a slight obsession of mine lately. I am trying to dive deeper into that world and relearn a lot of the stuff I learned back in high school with it. The infrastructure world is pretty fascinating to me.</p>\n<h3>Random thoughts of the day</h3>\n<p>No real random thoughts today, I’m pretty burned out after a weekend spent hosting my parents and sleeping on the couch. I’m ready for bed so I can attack the day tomorrow.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 10","date":"February 10, 2020","description":"Just a daily log of my thoughts and what I'm working on today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/02-10-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-09-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Thoughts: February 9"}},"next":null}}}
