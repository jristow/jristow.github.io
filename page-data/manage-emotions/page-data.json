While all of them are important and it is difficult to say one is definitively more important that any others, there is one that doesn’t necessarily get talked about enough. Being able to manage peoples emotions is often an underrated skill for leaders and managers. Leading people and getting their buy in on any work often comes down to managing their emotions.</p>\n<p>When you connect with people on an emotional level, it builds a stronger feeling of trust. They feel like you see them as a person and not just another cog in the machine. When you build this trust it becomes easier to provide them feedback, they feel like you are providing it to them in order to help them grow and not trying to tear them down. </p>\n<p>This isn’t an easy thing to do by any means. We are all human and we can struggle managing our own emotions in high stress situations. But it is vital for anyone in a leadership position to learn how to bring your own emotions under control. Using mindfulness and daily meditations can help. Simple things like taking a few deep breaths when you feel your fight or flight response kicking in. Pausing to ensure you understand what someone is saying to you before responding. All of these are ways to help.</p>\n<p>Leading people with compassion not only makes you a better leader. It makes you a better human.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Managing People's Emotions","date":"October 11, 2019","description":"Analysis and decision making are what we often hear about when it comes to leading or managing people.
