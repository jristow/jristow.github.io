Looking at what truly motivates people, beyond a simply paycheck, requires an understanding of humans mental and emotional needs. Businesses and organizations are waking up to the fact that humans need to feel valued and that their work matters in order to do their best work. From my own personal experience, I learned that connecting with people on your team will build a trust that makes them want to go above and beyond when you ask them to.</p>\n<p>When I was given impossible tasks and told to make them happen, I would be very transparent with my team. I never tried sugar coating the situation or giving them any pep-talks. I would simply lay out what the objective was, take input on how we could accomplish it and then lead debate about which options were most likely to be successful. Eventually we would come to consensus on which option to choose, or I would make a decision if we couldn’t.</p>\n<p>Involving them in the process in this way helped to give the team ownership of the task. Not trying to sugar coat things let them know that I respected them enough to acknowledge the work would be difficult. All of this added up to them embracing the suck and getting the required work done.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Leading With Transparency","date":"October 22, 2019","description":"It's easy to get caught in the command and control leadership mentality, where people need to do what you say simply because you are in charge.
