Flights and Uber trips and crowds and constant motion. I am exhausted. How often do we feel exhausted when we are at work though? I know I feel pretty drained quite often when I am at work too. </p>\n<p>Tonight, I had the option to say “I don’t really feel like writing anything. I don’t have any inspiration tonight.” But at work we don’t have the option of saying I’m tired, I can’t take care of that problem today. We always have to find a way to get the work done. And so tonight, I am writing something. It may not be very good, it may not be anything inspiring. But sometimes, all we can do is put the work in.</p>\n<p>It’s not always going to be inspiring other people to do their best work. As a leader, you may have to step up and take care of things if others fall short. In these situations, all there is to do is shut up and do the work.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"It's Not Always Inspirational","date":"October 23, 2019","description":"I talk a lot about inspiring others to do their best work, but as a leader it's not always about inspiring others.
