At the beginning of October I set out a challenge for myself. Blog every day that month. 31 days of posts, good bad and ugly. I started off strong, easily knocking out a post per day for the first few weeks. After week two it got tougher to post things, my creativity was getting sapped. But I made it through week three simply by putting words on the screen.</p>\n<p>But then I took a trip. It threw me off my normal routine and I missed the last week of posts. I could use life circumstances as an excuse. But excuses don’t cut it in the real world. At the end of the day, I missed the goal I set for myself.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, we will all miss a deadline. Balancing all of the competing priorities we have in life, eventually a ball will get dropped. When this happens, we can’t allow ourselves to wallow in pity. Staying focused on taking action is the only way forward.</p>\n<p>I threw myself a little pity party when I missed a day of writing in October. Then it stretched into November. “I don’t have any ideas right now” I told myself. It was a way to appease my guilt for not following through. Instead of staying disciplined and just putting words down on paper, I used excuses.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying I failed because I didn’t make it through the month of October posting every day. I failed because when adversity struck, I let it derail me. Instead of brushing off a few missed days and continuing to make progress, I gave up.</p>\n<p>We will all face some adversity in life. How we respond is the only thing we can control. We can allow the adversity to derail us. Or we can look for the lesson in that adversity and use that to move forward in life.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"December Update","date":"December 02, 2019","description":"This blog has been kind of quiet for the past month."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/december-update/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/simple-things/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"It's Not Always Inspirational"}},"next":null}}}
