This particular conversation was centered on military leadership, but we can talk about some of the principles more generally.</p>\n<p>In my mind, we shouldn’t be drawing distinctions between authoritativeness and humility. Or strategic thinking versus vulnerability. Old-school versus new-school. All of these qualities are important in a leader. We should be working to build humility within ourselves while still knowing when we need to be authoritative.</p>\n<p>If you are an aspiring leader focused on building out your analytical capabilities, don’t forget about the soft skills. When people feel like they are cared for as people and when they are treated as something more than just another cog in the machine, they will go the extra mile for you. Anything less and they will simply do the minimum it takes to avoid being yelled at.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Command and Control vs. Heart-led Leadership","date":"October 21, 2019","description":"A lot of discussions around leadership theories tend to revolve around this framework versus that framework or leaders need this quality over that quality. Instead of pitting different qualities against each other, we should instead look at how growing a variety of qualities can drastically improve our ability to lead people."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/heart-led/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/leading-up/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Leading Up"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/transparency/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Leading With Transparency"}}}}}
