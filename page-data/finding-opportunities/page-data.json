What are some ways to showcase your leadership skillset and potential, without having a title that tells people you are the leader? First, let’s differentiate between a manager and a leader. A lot of people automatically associate managers with leaders, since that is the person they are supposed to follow at work. But not all leaders are going to be managers and not all managers will be good leaders. The best leaders I have worked with and for are the ones who can make a genuine connection with you as a person.</p>\n<p>When you think you are at the point in your career where you want to take on a leadership role, it can seem daunting. How will they know I can handle this extra responsibility? What can I do to “prove” myself to the higher ups? One of the key skills you must have is communication. Be willing to have tough conversations with the people leading you and be able to clearly articulate why you think the way you do. Speaking well is a skill that too few people practice, if you can set yourself apart from the crowd, others will notice. One skill that can help in this area is learning to take a breath before you respond to any comment. Compose your response in your head before speaking it. On this same path, talk to your direct manager about your aspirations. Let them know you think you are ready for a higher level position and get feedback from them. Being able to understand your blind spots is another area to work on.</p>\n<p>Outside of communication, remember that as a leader, you are responsible for ensuring things get done. Make sure you are on top of completing your assigned resonsibilities on time. Keep an eye out for team members who may be struggling and see if there is a way you can help them. Being known as the person who will help others get things done, along with getting your own work done, will go a long way to show your ability to lead a group. Doing this without someone asking will show initiative. If you are presented with a situation where an important decision needs to be made, build an argument for why one choice is more optimal than another. Present this to your manager when you go to them. Leading people is a lot of decision making, highlighting your ability to think critically about an issue to determine a path forward is crucial.</p>\n<p>Beyond just communicating or getting stuff done, look at ways you can reach back and help people who are junior to you. Offer to be a mentor for new employees. Organize informal or formal groups to learn new skills or grow existing skillsets. Find little ways to take initiative. At the end of the day, your title doesn’t matter. True leaders are the ones people look to in a crisis, who is going to remain calm and find a way through it. Showing the ability to do that isn’t tough but it does take extra effort. Ultimately it is that extra effort that will signal to people you have what it takes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finding Leadership Opportunities","date":"October 09, 2019","description":"Someone asked me how they could show they are ready to lead even when they aren't in a position of leadership.
