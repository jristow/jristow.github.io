Normally I’m not one to enjoy these, like most other people, because everything feels so transactional. But this event, Meet ATX, sounded like it may be a little different. Instead of the normal meet people, have drinks, maybe exchange info and then go home, the organizers have set up guided conversations with some of Austins’ business leaders. Last night we heard from Heath Brunner, the CEO of WPEngine. Overall, I think the event was valuable and I plan on going back when they host more. </p>\n<h3>If you dont ask, the answer is always no.</h3>\n<p>I think the biggest takeaway I had from listening to Heather is the power of simply asking for what you want. As she was telling her story and answering questions, this theme kept popping up. She mentioned several times where she got a position simply because she had asked for more responsbility or asked to learn a new skill. The people she had talked to remembered her asking and brought opportunities to her. If no one knows what you want, how can you expect to get it?</p>\n<h3>It’s all about the relationships.</h3>\n<p>It was interesting to hear another common theme that continued to pop up throughout her talk: building good relationships. During her career, she had the opportunity to meet and build relationships with people who would continue to support her. The timing of hearing this was pretty powerful, since I have been reflecting on what helped me to be successful and realizing it was always key relationships. It is just a reminder that when you build authentic relationships, they can magnify your ability to be successful.</p>\n<h3>Karma is powerful.</h3>\n<p>This point was something that I have believed in for a while. Whether you call it karma or something else, the idea that if you put good out into the world, you will be repaid is incredibly powerful. Hearing someone who has had great success remind me of this was encouraging. It encouraged me to continue writing down what I have learned from my experiences and putting it out into the world.</p>\n<h3>5 Questions</h3>\n<p>One of the most powerful things I took away from Heather is actually a set of questions she said she asks herself continuously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I growing?</li>\n<li>Am I learning?</li>\n<li>Am I having fun?</li>\n<li>Does my manager have my back?</li>\n<li>Do I have a plan for the future?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are powerful questions that can help anyone. Especially those people who are feeling unfulfilled in their careers. The first three are great “compass” questions to help you know if what you are doing currently aligns with who you are as a person. The last one is one that people often overlook, we get bogged down in the day to day stresses and don’t look at where our current path is taking us. The fourth one is especially powerful when you are questioning what you are currently doing. In my experience, most of the times when I haven’t enjoyed a job it stemmed from a feeling of the manager not being invested in me.</p>\n<p>There was a lot more she covered but I was focused on listening and trying to take it all in so I didn’t write down any more notes. If you have the opportunity to go listen to any leader talk, I would definitely suggest you take it. If you’re in Austin, I believe they host these Meet ATX events the first Tuesday of every month. Come check it out and say hi if you do!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Conversation with Heather Brunner, WPEngine CEO","date":"October 02, 2019","description":"Last night I had the opportunity to attend an event where WPEngine CEO Heather Brunner was speaking.
