&lt;p&gt;As a leader/manager in an organization, it is crucial to create highly effective teams. When a team coalesces around a central vision, they can magnify the effectiveness of the individual contributors. But how do leaders create this buy in? Shouldn’t people give everything they can because we are giving them a paycheck? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relationships based on authentic connections are key.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your team’s only motivation is a paycheck, you create a transactional relationship, where they are only as invested as they need to be to get their payoff. If you instead focus on building a relationship based on mutual respect, that person is more willing to go the extra mile for you. When each member of your team is willing to go above and beyond, that is when you create the most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a bold vision, then create buy in.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining a bold guiding vision for your team is an often over looked step in building high functioning teams. If you, as the manager, can define the direction you are going and then build excitement around that vision, it makes the team feel more connected to their work. Without some guiding vision, a team will wander aimlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for managers to get bogged down in the day to day drudgery of keeping a system moving. Meetings, phone calls, interviews all suck time and energy away from what their core focus should be. But it is crucial to take time to define the overall vision for a team and build consensus around that. If a manager fails to do this, they are losing out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Be Strategic in Your Career Choices]]></title><description><![CDATA[So recently I was having a conversation with someone about work and career progression and they made a comment that got me thinking.

They said &lt;em&gt;“You don’t need to worry about your career, you just need to worry about finding the next position. Your career will develop later.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some context, my current role isn’t permanently assigned to a single team, and they were referring to me landing a permanent spot on a team. But zooming out a little, there are a few things we can explore with this statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the initial positions we take in our careers can drastically shape what future positions are available to us. In software engineering, if you start out focused solely on frontend work it can be difficult to transition into a backend position after that. Or if you go into a specialized role like DevOps, you may be pigeonholed the rest of your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, focusing solely on landing that next position without considering what our ultimate career goals are, is short sighted. If we want to become a CTO, it doesn’t make sense to work on becoming the most technically smart engineer. We need to branch out into managing teams and learning how to shape and steer the strategy of our company. Conversely, if we want to move into a lead technical role, architecting the systems and deployment strategies it doesn’t make sense to get into management positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is going to know what they want to end up as in their career and thats okay. Some people are totally happy just moving from one job to another without worrying about achieving some end goal. But a lot of people are unhappy with their jobs and often it boils down to them not doing what they feel like they want to do. Often, they can’t tell you exactly why they got into their current position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have some long term vision for our career, we cannot complain when we end up somewhere we don’t want to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Step One: Diagnosis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Good strategy is built on an underlying structure that anyone can use in their own life.

We can generalize three distinct phases in strategic thinking and then build a process we follow. Typically, these phases can be identified as diagnosis, guiding policy and action plans. Today we are going to focus on the diagnosis portion. How do we go about diagnosing a situation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly identifying our current position is the key motivator during diagnosis. In military strategy this is when the scouts are out finding the enemies locations, watching their movements and identifying key parts of the battlefield. In life, this would be the time spent assessing what your current situation is. What does your career look like? What do your relationships look like? What is the general direction you are headed? Asking yourself these and other similar questions will help you diagnose the current state of your battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a good tool to use during diagnosis?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since diagnosis is all about gathering information and building out your “map of the territory”, the most effective and simplest tool available to us are questions. A lot of times, we avoid asking questions because we worry that we will appear incompetent. We worry people will question why we are in our position if we have to ask all these questions. In reality, we all have blind spots and asking questions is the easiest way to minimize our blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;“When you become a leader your job is to define the problem. Not solve it”&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, during diagnosis the goal is to identify the current state of things. As we explore the current state, the possibility for emotional reactions to what we discover exists. We need to focus solely on gathering the information during this stage and not jumping into some action based on our emotions. Expanding our understanding will allow us to build a plan to move us closer to where we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alright, What Exactly is Strategic Thinking?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Strategy: a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertaintity. —WikipediaIn life, we often set goals for…]]></description><link>https://jordanristow.com/what-is-strategy/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanristow.com/what-is-strategy/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Strategy: a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertaintity. —Wikipedia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we often set goals for ourselves, or we build out a vision for how we want situations to play out. We tend to look towards the future and see ourselves in certain situations. But how do we get from where we are today, to those future situations? For most people, we just kind of hope that we will end up there. But there are people who actually sit down and look at ways to potentially reach those endpoints. This is the heart of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dictionary definition of strategy: The science and art of using all the forces of a nation to execute approved plans as effectively as possible during peace or war.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people tend to relate strategy immediately to military strategy, which is where the word originated from. The Greek origins of strategy directly translate to the art of troop leader or general. But strategic thinking has proven useful beyond the battle field, as we can see with the increase in Strategic Planning teams within large business organizations. While these may seem like totally unrelated areas, both military and businesses must deal with limited resources, constantly changing landscapes and contending with outside entities that are actively trying to outmaneuver them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, boiling all of these definitions down to a straight forward explanation: strategy is the overarching vision we have in place to get to “desirable ends with available means”. Strategy is not the individual steps we need to take to get to these ends, those are tactics. Strategy tends to focus more on the what than the how. Now that we have the basics of what strategy is, we can start exploring how to apply it in different life situations. Check back later this week for the next installment!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Strategy Project]]></title><description><![CDATA[For anyone who has been following me, you have seen the series I was doing on Naval Ravikants tweetstorm on how to create wealth.

I got up to his post on how the internet has enabled people to scale their niche obsession and reach thousands of people with similar interests and it got me thinking on how I can better leverage what I am doing with my website. One topic that has been very interesting to me lately has been strategy and how people can use it in their life and careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Where did all of this strategy talk come from Jordan?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous work position, I was put in charge of 30 people across three teams. I had no idea what to do or how to manage the chaos I had been dropped into. My first six months were a blur of reading everything I could find on what the goal of the department was as well as how to manage people. It was a similar situation to the one Shane Parrish from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.blog&quot;&gt;fs.blog&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I needed to learn about setting the vision for a whole department, along with ensuring that vision lined up with the overall vision of the organization. It was a tough spot to be in for someone who never planned to be in that position from the beginning (more on this in a future post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats the short version of what got me invested in learning strategic thinking and planning. After that initial shockwave, I realized this thinking could be applied to a lot of other areas in life and I started exploring different ways to apply it. It also led me to start reading everything I could find on strategy, including topics on game theory and old war strategy books. And now, after feeling lost with how to direct this website, I plan on presenting this information to you readers. If there are any topics you want to learn about, please reach out and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Give Society What It Doesn't Know How To Get -- My Thoughts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earlier this year @naval posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up.

Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it &lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give Society What it Doesn’t Know how to Get — at scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working to create massive wealth, it is the people and companies that identify what society wants and can deliver that to society at scale that will win. When we think about some of today’s most successful companies, we see a similar pattern. Apple perfected the smartphone and then made it accessible to billions of people. Google made the worlds information available to everyone, not just the people who could afford to buy lots of books. Uber brought the world of private car services to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common thread among these companies is that the original product was once seen as a luxury that only rich people could afford. These companies came along and made that luxury available to the masses and it so doing, created vast wealth for their shareholders. Some cases, the companies invented an entirely new category that people had not thought of before. Others were an evolution with some defining characteristic that set them apart. In either case, it was opening up the availability that helped propel the wealth creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Live Below Your Means -- My Thoughts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earlier this year @naval posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up.

Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has a few things going on in it. Starting out, he talks about lifestyle upgrades and how people tend to upgrade their lifestyles too quickly. We get a raise at work and immediately look for how we can improve our life with that money. Usually, the thing that would improve our lives most, gets overlooked, and that is buying back part of your freedom. Instead, we look at upgrading the car or house. This happens slowly and we don’t really notice the changes while we are making them. But then one day, we’re making $100 an hour and still have no money left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the easiest trap we can fall into that prevents us from building true wealth. I know I am guilty of it, I  wound up buying three new cars in succession when I was younger. Each one a worse decision than the previous one. Luckily I have started moving past this behavior, but I still find myself wanting to upgrade my life as I grow in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing he points out, that I had never thought about, is the ideal way to make a lot of money. If we slowly build up to a very high hourly rate, we still have a hard time accumulating money. However, if we were to instead have some immediate windfall, we wouldn’t have the problem of lifestyle creep. Obviously, we would want to make sure not to spend all of the money we just made, but making these discrete chunks of money usually leaves us better off than slow and steady buildups of hourly wage gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this post, I really want to focus on finding ways to just make discrete chunks of money instead of building up my hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Just Do The Work]]></title><description><![CDATA[I often find myself wanting to write.

I’ll be at home, at work or out and about and thing to myself “I really want to just sit down and write for a bit.” But then I find all sorts of little things to do to avoid writing. Checking Instagram or Twitter. Messing with my LinkedIn profile. Washing the dishes (weird I know). Literally anything to keep from sitting down in front of the computer to actually write something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some times, I do get writers block. So I honestly can’t think of the words I want to say when I sit down. This happens to everyone and is completely normal. Usually though, if I force myself to sit there I will start throwing out random thoughts and eventually coalesce into some semi-coherent rambling. This is, from what I hear, the normal writing process for a lot of people. But in these cases, I forced myself to show up and do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of us do similar things with other parts of our lives? Wanting a relationship, wanting to get fit, wanting to eat better. We do everything else, saying eventually we’ll get to that hard thing we really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got myself back in the gym and on a regular workout program, which got me thinking about this topic. I didn’t make any excuses for not going to the gym, but once I got back in, I kept wanting to quit the workout halfway through. But that wouldn’t have given me any progress or satisfaction. So I did the work and I am seeing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience reminded me of what I have long known, but tend to forget. We just need to do the work. Instead of putting it off or making excuses or trying to hack our way around the work, just do it. Suck up the short term pain and get it over with. The payoff is always worth the work you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[You Won't Get Rich Renting Out Your Time -- My Thoughts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earlier this year @naval posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up.

Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing my exploration of Naval’s thread on how to create wealth, let’s explore his thoughts on renting out your time, aka working for someone else. One of the key things he highlights about working for someone else, is that your compensation is tied directly to your inputs. Every hour you are there, you get some compensation, and no matter how much that hourly compensation is, you only earn it when you show up. Your job won’t pay you while you sleep. It won’t pay you if you take an extended leave of absence. In order to make money during times you aren’t being productive, you have to own a piece of the business. This way, anytime the company makes money, you are making money as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging a little deeper into inputs vs outputs, it starts to become clear that we need to find an area where our outputs scale non-linearly from our inputs. Creating content, building a digital platform for people to use, creating other software systems. These all scale non-linearly. Your book can reach potentially millions of people, but you don’t have to do any extra work for it to go from one person to a million. This is where his point about mismatched inputs/outputs really comes into play. Even this post, could potentially reach a large audience for just an hour of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final thing to highlight, he points out that when you rent out your time, you are replaceable. You may be really good at whatever your job is, but there is always someone else who would be willing to do that work. Maybe even at a cheaper price than they are paying you. So it’s really easy to get replaced when you are working for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading through his post/thoughts about this, it has given me even more motivation to continue investing in companies and work on pursuing my own opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making Better Decisions with a Radically Open Mind]]></title><description><![CDATA[How do we make better decisions?

What are the biggest hindrances people face when trying to make decisions? In regular life as well as business, it is often viewed that whoever can make the fastest decision will win the situations. In reality, it is whoever makes the best decision quickly who often winds up winning. But what goes into making a better decision? Most companies don’t put time into training their people on how to make better decisions. Most people just go about it the best they can. Stumbling through life making the most optimal decisions they know how. But usually these decisions aren’t the true optimal decision. Our brains have a lot of subliminal ways to hide things we aren’t strong in to protect our ego. We are terrible at recognizing what our blind spots are and this leads us to overconfidence in predicting outcomes of our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Well cool Jordan, thanks for completely destroying my fragile mental state already. Do you have any advice on how to get better at this?” -Anyone reading this, probably. Maybe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision making is a very complex process. We take in information, analyze it, make predictions about trends we may see and then use all of that to come to some conclusion. A lot of discussion around decision making focuses on the analysis and prediction portions of this process. Every article out there talking about mental models is really focused on ways to analyze and predict. But what happens if the information supporting that analysis isn’t 100% accurate? How do we know we have good information to begin with? Any analysis or prediction based on faulty information is going to fail, no matter how good the techniques used to make it. How can we dial in on the truth when we seek out information? One promising place to start is with radical open-mindedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical open-mindedness is a concept Ray Dalio explores a lot in his book Principles. Essentially, it boils down to opening ourselves up to being wrong. Welcoming disagreements as a pursuit of finding out what is true, instead of viewing them as fights to be won. Suspending our ego and accepting that we will not always have the correct answer and that is okay. Focusing on achieving our goal instead of looking good by always having the answer. Finally, reaching out to different experts and having them explain opposing viewpoints to you from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ego and Blind Spots: The Twin Pillars of Terrible Decision Making&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest obstacle in drilling down into what is true, tends to be ourselves. I know, shocking. We’re all amazing thinkers and see things clearly all of the time. Not. Our brains are very good at protecting our ego. Ego, everyone has one but no one wants to admit it. It is that part of us that experiences and reacts to the outside world. It is the part of us that gets bruised when we find out we are wrong. What causes us to cling to ideas, even when we have seen they are incorrect. The ego prevents us from recognizing our blind spots, those areas where we don’t know as much as we think we know. These two combined, ego and blind spots, are our two greatest barriers to finding out what is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes in this area comes from Ray Dalio. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Replace your attachment to being right with the joy of learning what’s true.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found this to be a strong guiding light in my own quest for better decisions. Anytime we feel upset during a discussion, we should take a step back and recognize, it is probably stemming from our ego trying to protect us from being hurt. During these moments we need to fight to suspend our ego and accept that maybe you are actually wrong. A lot of times we get caught up in trying to look good, by having the correct answer, but if we don’t actually have the correct answer, we wind up looking bad. We need to shift our focus to simply achieving our goal, and accepting that maybe this time we don’t have the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still in the process of being radically open-minded, working to suspend my ego and approach situations assuming I am wrong. I am constantly battling old tendencies of assuming I am the smartest person at the table. But I am making progress on it. Share with me your progress on suspending your ego!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Brief Catch Up & Currently Reading]]></title><description><![CDATA[Howdy, y’all!So, June and July have been some hectic months.

&lt;p&gt;So, June and July have been some hectic months. I moved to Texas, started a new job and have been slowly getting settled in and exploring my new city. This has kind of put a damper on my energy and focus to write and put out new content. But, I am starting to feel more settled, so I plan on starting to make more time for writing and creating new content for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this, I want to start highlighting some of the items I read each week that really open my eyes. You know, another generic weekly roundup type of blog post. However, I plan on including not only articles, but also books that I am reading and some background information on those books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also plan on shifting the focus of the blog from the random software development/personal finance focus I have had to more of a critical thinking/decision analysis focus. I have been reading a lot in both of these areas lately and want to start writing things about them to help myself remember the topics, and if my writing benefits someone else out there then thats even better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough catch up let’s talk about what I’ve been reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Blogs&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Collaborative Fund&lt;/a&gt;:
So this first one isn’t a particular post, but the overall blog over at Collaborative Fund always has some really interesting articles. Mostly focused on finance, but theres some good gems about overall decision making included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/&quot;&gt;Calculated Risk&lt;/a&gt;:
I actually found this blog from Collaborative Fund, but it has a lot of really interesting economic data commentary. Not quite focused on decision making, but any decision requires facts to help guide it and he provides some incredible fact based analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich/#more-28492840&quot;&gt;Naval on Wealth&lt;/a&gt;:
This is more a series of blog posts and podcasts, which I started writing up key takeaways and action items from, but life got in the way. I may dive back into working on that again, or I may forget it. Either way, you should go read this entire series for yourself. Naval and team provide a lot of powerful takeaways to think about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Books&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a few of these are older ones but they still hold a lot of wisdom in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principles - Ray Dalio: This is one of the grails for helping make better decisions. He walks through a lot of algorithms anyone can employ to help make better decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stumbling on Happiness - Daniel Gilbert: This is one I have had for a few years and never quite finished. But he walks through a lot of science behind happiness in people and why we are always wrong about what will make us most happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Art of Gathering - Priya Parker: This is an excellent discussion about our current problems with meetings and really any other gathering. She walks through great strategies to help improve your future gatherings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Podcast&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a huge podcast person, but I did listen to a couple recently that had a lot of good points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.madfientist.com/ramit-sethi-interview/&quot;&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/a&gt;:
The Mad Fientist is a great resource for really streamlining your tax efficiency strategies. This podcast episode he has a very solid conversationn with Ramit Sethi about FIRE and other aspects of saving and spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/naval-ravikant&quot;&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/a&gt;:
Normally, I’m not a Joe Rogan fan. But this episode with Naval was absolutely brilliant. Expanding on the series I posted in blogs, they do a deep dive on wealth creation in this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That’s everything!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is starting to get really long, so I’m going to wrap it up. Hopefully you check out some of these resources, if you do, please share how they have impacted you.&lt;/p&gt;

*Earlier this year [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval) posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up. Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it [here](https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840)). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.*
&lt;p&gt;This conversation discusses the concept and role of luck required to become wealthy. There is a common misconception that wealthy people somehow lucked into their wealth, when really a majority of wealthy people got there by working really hard at some craft. Building something that created value for the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naval highlights four types of luck that play different roles in how people can create wealth. The first, blind luck, is what people traditionally credit with making others wealthy. This is the lottery winner, some external event happens that I have no control over that makes me wealthy. Second, we have luck from hustling, where we are always moving, creating opportunities until the right opportunity hits. Third is luck from preparation, which is tied to being skilled in a field and being able to notice when a lucky break happens in that field. Finally there is luck from your unique character, which is weird. It is based on you building a unique character, brand or mindset where then luck finds you. I think the best way to summarize this one is this line “You created your own luck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We cannot hope that luck will make us wealthy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can build a skillset/product where we are in demand, which is a special type of luck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth stacks up one chip at a time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this one, my main action item is to continue reading and working on my critical thinking and decision making skills. Along with my software engineering knowledge, eventually this will put me in position to do some incredible work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Free Markets are Intrinsic to Humans -- My Thoughts]]></title><description><![CDATA[This entry covers the converstaion around free markets and how they are intrinsic to humans.

*Earlier this year [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval) posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up. Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it [here](https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840)). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.*
&lt;p&gt;This entry covers the converstaion around free markets and how they are intrinsic to humans. One of the things I have found to be incredible with Naval is how he reframes ideas. This one in particular, I never thought about a conversation as being a value exchange. But he highlights how we as humans inherently track credits and debits, in the context of a conversation. If I am talking to you and feel like I am not getting enough value out of it, I will stop the conversation. He uses this as a parallel to how we operate in the free market. If you have a good or service I want, it will cost me some value to get that good or service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also draws comparisons to organic systems, where there are parasites and symbiotes that come together to create a functioning system. Some organisms take nutrients and return a different form of that nutrient, while others just take and take and take. This part of the conversation shifted the focus to groups that despise wealth and want to redistribute it throughout society. They highlight what is happening in Venezuela as the epitome of a society that focused on redistributing wealth without incentivizing the creation of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanity is the only species that keeps track of credits/debits.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This inherent tracking is the same as free markets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, for me, the biggest action item I have from this one is just going to be focusing on bringing equal value to every transaction I participate in.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Make Abundance for the World - My Thoughts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earlier this year @naval posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/naval&quot;&gt;@naval&lt;/a&gt; posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up. Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it &lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This converstaion was very interesting to me. As someone who grew up in a blue collar family, there was almost this taboo about wanting to be rich. There was this belief that rich people stole their wealth from someone else. Looking at wealth as a fixed quantity, not as something that can be increased across all of humanity. Naval highlights how this is an incorrect view of the economy, that in fact the economy can continue increasing in size as people start adding newer things of value to the overall system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth is not a zero sum game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True wealth creates abundance for the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at building wealth as adding new things of value to the world, we no longer have to think about how we can “trick” someone out of their money. We can instead start looking for holes that need to be filled. Anytime we think, “there should be a different way to do this,” we should instantly start ideating on that. Trying to identify why it is frustrating to us and how we can reduce or remove that frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I think the paragraph above really sums up what my action item is going to be from this particular tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for pain points in life and try to solve them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status - My Thoughts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earlier this year @naval posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/naval&quot;&gt;@naval&lt;/a&gt; posted a long tweetstorm about how to get rich without getting lucky, which blew up. Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it &lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first discussion is focused on differentiating between wealth, money and status. Often people tend to mix these three up and view them as interchangable. Obviously someone who attends high status social events will be wealthy and have a lot of money. Instead of just applying that blanket thought to all three, we should actually look at what each one really is. Naval provides a great definition for each of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money is how we transfer wealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status is your rank in the social hierarchy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation around these concepts is very good and I would encourage you to listen to the full recording, it’s only six minutes long. But today I want to just highlight a few take aways I had and then provide a few ways I plan on putting these concepts into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on creating wealth, instead of getting caught up in the typical status games people play. Status games are inherently zero-sum games which means there will be a winner and a loser. Focusing on these games will satisfy our baser instincts, but will rarely have material impacts on our ability to achieve freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a wealth transfer based on the time we put into something. When we create wealth for ourselves, we are buying back time to spend on things we are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can classify a lot of the keeping up with the Joneses and FOMO spending as status seeking behavior. We all want the nice car or house to signal to the world we are doing “well” at the career/economic game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build something of my own.&lt;/strong&gt; I have had an itch to create my own business for a while, but I never knew what to do. I need to make a leap and try something, even if it is a simple coaching side hustle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past few years I have been slowly increasing the portion of my income I dedicate to investment. I need to ramp that up even more now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove status from my value equations.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn’t matter what type of car I drive or what the size of my house/apartment is. I am not trying to be better than anyone else based on the material posessions I own.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Who is Jordan Ristow?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Allow me to reintroduce myself…Since I’ve revamped my site, I figured it would be a good idea to provide a bit more detail on who I am and…]]></description><link>https://jordanristow.com/about-me-post/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jordanristow.com/about-me-post/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Allow me to reintroduce myself…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve revamped my site, I figured it would be a good idea to provide a bit more detail on who I am and what my story is (so far). Especially since right now the site is more focused on blogging than being my online portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Just the highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Jordan! After being miserable with my life, I recently made a huge leap of faith, quit my old job, sold all of my belongings and moved to Austin Texas. I realized I needed focus on what would make me happy instead of worrying about other peoples expectations of me. So here I am, reinventing myself and enjoying life again. This blog is going to be my attempt at documenting my transition as well as an avenue to explore three of my favorite topics: software engineering, personal finance and philsophy/psychology.
