&lt;p&gt;So, after running through most of the tutorial on gatsby, I wanted to do a quick write up on my overall impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t played around with too many other static site generators, but I have really enjoyed the developer experience gatsby provides. I have wanted to work with both React and GraphQL and this gave me the perfect use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started was incredibly easy as well. I built a new project with one of their simple starters and had it up and running on my GitHub page with ease. It took me a little bit of time playing around with different components to get the basic look and content the way I wanted, but deploying it was a breeze with the gh-pages plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I customize and build out new parts of my site, I plan on writing up the process and how I did it. But for now, I wanted to throw up some quick impressions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Website/Blog]]></title><description><![CDATA[We’re BAAAAAACK!!!!Well, I spent most of this weekend messing around with gatsby.js to build up this new blog/website.

&lt;p&gt;Well, I spent most of this weekend messing around with gatsby.js to build up this new blog/website. I finally got most of it sorted out and got this barebones blog up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks I plan on building out a few more pages focused on who I am, what I do and showing some examples of my work. Kind of like an online resume. During all of this, I will do a more detailed write up of my experience working with gatsby.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I plan on posting more blog items focused on philosophy and personal finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for hanging around with me!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
