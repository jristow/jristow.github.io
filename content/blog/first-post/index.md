# Welcome to my newly redesigned web presence and blog!

I have been working to update my existing website and upgrade my overall web presence. I figured a software developer should have a better looking site than what I had pulled together previously.

I also wanted to play around with gatsby.js, a JavaScript based static page generator framework. I will work to do a more detailed write up about it later on, but suffice to say it was overall a success.

Redesigning my website isn't completely over, this was just a quick MVP to add in blog capabilities. I plan on spending the next few weeks building out a more robust about me section and a section with some front end example work.

Thanks for sticking with me, I plan on adding more content as time goes on.
