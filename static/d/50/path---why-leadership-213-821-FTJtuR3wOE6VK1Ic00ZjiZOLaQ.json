One of the strategies I identified was finding a goal that aligns with our purpose or meaning in life. For the longest time I couldn’t figure out what meaning or purpose I had.

Doing this helps me to understand weaknesses I have as well as allows me to see connections that I missed when I was living through these experiences. When I do this, I tend to break my life up into a few distinct phases and look at what was going on during each phase. Recently I began noticing a common theme that popped up repeatedly during these phases of my life.</p>\n<h3>College Life</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finding Our Purpose","date":"October 07, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/why-leadership/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/motivation-or-dedication/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are You Motivated or Dedicated?"}},"next":null}}
