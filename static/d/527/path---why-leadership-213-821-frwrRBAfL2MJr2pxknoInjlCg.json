One of the strategies I identified was finding a goal that aligns with our purpose or meaning in life. For the longest time I couldn’t figure out what meaning or purpose I had. Today I wanted to share a little of my experience that helped me to understand and find a true purpose.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been an introspective person, looking back on life, reviewing what I’ve done and how I can be a better human. Doing this helps me to understand weaknesses I have as well as allows me to see connections that I missed when I was living through these experiences. When I do this, I tend to break my life up into a few distinct phases and look at what was going on during each phase. Recently I began noticing a common theme that popped up repeatedly during these phases of my life.</p>\n<h3>College Life</h3>\n<p>While I was in undergrad, I was searching for that traditional college experience. I wanted to get out, make new friends and go to parties. One day I got an email inviting me to an informational session about a new fraternity that was coming to campus. I had been curious about greek life and thought, why not check it out? After the informational session, I remember being excited by what they stood for, but also by the challenge of building something new. If I joined, I would be on the ground floor of this new chapter, shaping the organization from day one. I was hooked immediately.</p>\n<h3>Early Career</h3>\n<p>My first job out of undergrad was working as a project manager/project engineer in a government office. I was by far the youngest person in the office and one of the only project managers that was also an engineer. There were a lot of problems in this office, people who had worked together for years and allowed old grudges to fester. It made for an unpleasant working situation. My role was not a leader or manager role, I was just an individual contributor. But, because I was new and didn’t have all of these previous experiences biasing my actions, people soon started turning to me to help interface between different offices. The acqusitions people would call me and ask me to help one of the engineers clarify his documents. Other project managers would ask me how to approach the acquisitions people without starting a fight. I had become the fixer.</p>\n<h3>Mid Career</h3>\n<p>After my time as a project manager, I accepted a position managing a small department at a new location. This role would be my first true leadership role but I would soon realize it wasn’t just going to be a simple management gig. When I showed up, the organization was going through a massive IT system upgrade that required changing a lot of old business processes. Further, they hadn’t completed the requirements of a previous reorganization effort, leaving them with a lot of duplicate processes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finding Our Purpose","date":"October 07, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/why-leadership/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/motivation-or-dedication/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are You Motivated or Dedicated?"}},"next":null}}
