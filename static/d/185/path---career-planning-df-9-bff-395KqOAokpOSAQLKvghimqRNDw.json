It was 2012 and the country was still starting to recover from the real estate bubble popping, there weren’t a lot of opportunities out there. I did the normal job search and eventually landed a job as a project manager. This wasn’t necessarily my “dream job” but I had student loans to repay. So I took it.</p>\n<p>I had no real idea how to work on building my career. I thought it was just a linear process, start as a junior project manager, find a more senior role and you make your way up that way. But I realized that it didn’t quite work like that. If I didn’t have an idea of what the next job I wanted was, I couldn’t work to build the necessary skills I would need to highlight to get that job. This led to a lot of frustration when I was ready to move on from this first role.</p>\n<p>If I had spent time during those first few years seeking out feedback on areas I needed improvement, had honest conversations with people in positions that interested me and used that information to develop myself it would have made the job search a lot easier. When you narrow in on a particular role that interests you, you can make sure you have the skills required to excel in that role. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Career Planning","date":"October 15, 2019","description":"Looking at what skills you need to move into a new role is crucial to help you plan out a career."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/career-planning/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/communication/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Effective Communication"}},"next":null}}
