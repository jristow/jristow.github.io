I try to avoid injecting my own opinions because that tends to muddy the waters. Recently, I’ve gotten a lot of good feedback from people focused on how I can improve the content I provide. One of the biggest pieces of feedback I received though was focused on opening up more and sharing specific experiences I have had.</p>\n<p>After getting this feedback, I decided to start up a weekly feature where I do just that. Identify a situation I found myself in, lay out what put me in that situation and how I handled it, good or bad. </p>\n<p>This brings me to the main point of today’s post, besides announcing a new feature. Put yourself out there to receive feedback from people. Seek it out. If you want to grow into being a better and more effective leader, look for your blind spots. Only when you are open to this feedback and actively seek it out will you be able to grow into the leader you are meant to be.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting A Little More Personal","date":"October 13, 2019","description":"Talking with some friends recently they mentioned being interested in hearing more about my personal experiences and highlighting the leadership lessons I learned from specific situations I found myself in."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/october-13/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/empathy-vs-compassion/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Empathy vs Compassion"}},"next":null}}
