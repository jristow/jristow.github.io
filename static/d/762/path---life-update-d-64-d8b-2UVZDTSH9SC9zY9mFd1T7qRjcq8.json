As I have mentioned in other places I recently left a job to start a new career as a software developer. Part of this change involved moving from Tucson to Austin Texas. With a detour to Idaho to visit family and friends.</p>\n<p>While I was in Idaho, I was actually able to take care of the site redesign I had been wanting to do as well as push out a bunch of articles. However, two weeks ago I had to make the long journey down to Austin. Which prevented me from putting any time towards writing. But, now I am finally semi settled here and am diving back in to writing.</p>\n<p>Right now I am working on a series of write ups about a tweet storm and podcast series that Naval Ravikant recently put out.
