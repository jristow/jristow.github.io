We can generalize three distinct phases in strategic thinking and then build a process we follow. Typically, these phases can be identified as diagnosis, guiding policy and action plans. Today we are going to focus on the diagnosis portion. How do we go about diagnosing a situation? </p>\n<p>There are several tools out there that can be used during diagnosis, but the most effective and simplest tool available to us are questions. A lot of times, we avoid asking questions because we worry that we will appear incompetent. We worry people will question why we are in our position if we have to ask all these questions. Really, asking questions is a sign of someone who has acknowledged their own blind spots. They have accepted that no single person can know everything and they are seeking information from those who may know more than them.</p>\n<p>Clearly identifying our current position is the key motivator during diagnosis. In military strategy this is when the scouts are out finding the enemies locations, watching their movements and identifying key parts of the battlefield. In life, this would be the time spent assessing what your current situation is. What does your career look like? What do your relationships look like? What is the general direction you are headed? Asking yourself these and other similar questions will help you diagnose the current state of your battlefield.</p>\n<h3>“When you become a leader your job is to define the problem. Not solve it”</h3>\n<p>Our ego tends to get in the way of properly diagnosing a given situation, we tend to think we know enough about it or that our understanding of the situation is complete. Rarely is this actually the case. Our brain is just very good at tricking us while trying to protect us. If we can learn to set aside our ego, we can start to properly diagnose problems and situations.</p>\n<p>To start diagnosing, the key action to take is to start asking questions. We tend to avoid asking questions for fear of looking foolish or stupid. We need to suspend this fear and focus on gaining a better understanding of our situation. Our focus should always be on achieving our goals, not looking good. There will be times when you won’t be the expert in an area, that is okay. It is your responsibility to find the experts and seek their feedback.</p>\n<p>After we ask questions and gain an understanding of the problem we are trying to solve, we want to look at other problems that may be related to the first problem. If we start to see a pattern of related problems, it could be a sign of a larger overarching problem with these smaller problems being symptoms. This is all part of root cause analysis, where you systematically review problems to find the core issue.</p>\n<p>Root cause analysis is a useful tool when we </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ask questions.</li>\n<li>Identify any related problems, they may be a sign of a larger overarching problem</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Step One: Diagnosis","date":"August 21, 2019","description":"When we start to implement strategic thinking it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and unsure of where or how to begin.
