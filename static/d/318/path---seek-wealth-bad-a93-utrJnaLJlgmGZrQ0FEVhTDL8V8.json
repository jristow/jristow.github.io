Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet. Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will explore what he talks about and kind of write my thoughts/take aways from each one.</em></p>\n<p>This first discussion provides a good breakdown of what differentiates wealth from money or status. I think there is a common misconception amongst most people, that higher incomes or attending higher status events means people are wealthy. While wealthy people may also have higher salaries and attend these events, the salary and status do not signal wealth. He does a good job summarizing the differences between these three.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Money is how we transfer wealth.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Status is your rank in the social hierarchy.</strong>\nFor me, the first of these was probably the one that took me longest to learn. Growing up, I was never exposed to this idea of building and growing wealth so my belief was that you had to increase your salary if you wanted to earn more money. I did not understand how investments could increase in value while I slept or dividends would be paid out without any active work from me. </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status - My Thoughts","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/seek-wealth/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/daily-algorithm-31-may/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Algorithm Practice - Valid Parentheses"}},"next":null}}
