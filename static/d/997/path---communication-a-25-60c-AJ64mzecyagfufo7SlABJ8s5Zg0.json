I had no idea what I was doing and no real guidance on what I should be doing. Anytime I asked my boss a question, he would send me someone elses work and tell me to try to reproduce what they made, however tailor it to my project. Anyone else have a similar story?</p>\n<p>It took me a few years to truly understand exactly what I was writing when I would pull together a statement of work. Coming from an engineering background, my world was numbers and equations, not written descriptions of what work I wanted someone else to perform.</p>\n<p>In order to succeed in that role, I had to work on my ability to explain tough technical concepts to people who did not have the same background as me. This was incredibly difficult, when you understand something so well and you feel like you explained it clearly but the other person didn’t understand. It can get super frustrating.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Effective Communication","date":"October 14, 2019","description":"Being able to clearly and effectively communicate with people is a challenge that everyone faces.
