Growing up, I never really had a hometown, bouncing from city to city, state to state and even country to country meant nowhere gave me that feeling of “home”. Until I moved to Boise for my undergrad.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, after spending 10 years here, I moved away for a new job opportunity. For the first year, I had this hole in me, which I attributed to just missing the city of Boise and not settling in to my new location. As time went on, I still felt that hole. It got to a point where I realized it wasn’t just missing the city. There was a feeling my memories of Boise brought up that had nothing to do with a specific location.</p>\n<p>The more I thought about it, I realized it wasn’t just the city itself. It was the community of people I was able to build while living there. Between friends from my undergrad days, people I met at crossfit and colleagues who became friends, I had an amazing community of people that really made my time in Boise feel like home.</p>\n<p>Our brains are incredibly powerful. This feeling that is associated to a place affects how I picture the city when I think about it. As time has passed, the people who made up that community have moved on with their lives, taking them out of the city. Physically, the city itself has changed with a lot of development happening while I’ve been away. These two factors combine together so every time I come back it feels less and less like the place I remember. More often, I find myself wondering if this is still the same city I originally fell in love with.</p>\n<p>What is the place that gives you that feeling of home? Do you find it being more related to the people you have there or the actual physical space?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Missing Places","date":"May 22, 2019","description":"Our minds ascribe a certain feeling to places we have in our memory, which influences how we view that places when reflecting on it."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/missing-places/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Who is Jordan Ristow?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/daily-algorithm-practice-23-may/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Daily Algorithm Work May 23, 2019"}}}}
