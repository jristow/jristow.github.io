Especially since right now the site is more focused on blogging than being my online portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Just the highlights</h2>\n<p>Hi, I’m Jordan! After being miserable with my life, I recently made a huge leap of faith, quit my old job, sold all of my belongings and moved to Austin Texas. I realized I needed focus on what would make me happy instead of worrying about other peoples expectations of me. So here I am, reinventing myself and enjoying life again. This blog is going to be my attempt at documenting my transition as well as an avenue to explore three of my favorite topics: software engineering, personal finance and philsophy/psychology.\nPlease tag along with me and reach out/connect with me if anything resonates with you.</p>\n<h4>Summary of Expertise:</h4>\n<h5>Education Background</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>BS in Materials Science and Engineering - Boise State University 12</li>\n<li>\n<p>MS in Software Development - Maryville University 18</p>\n<h5>Professional Background</h5>\n</li>\n<li>Charles Schwab, Associate Software Engineer June 2019 -</li>\n<li>United States Air Force, Operations Engineering Manager December 2016 - May 2019</li>\n<li>United States Air Force, Lead Project Manager August 2014 - December 2016</li>\n<li>United States Air Force, Mechanical Engineer August 2013 - July 2014</li>\n<li>\n<p>United States Air Force, Junior Engineer July 2012 - July 2013</p>\n<h5>Technical Capabilities</h5>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Python</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proficient with full stack development using Flask</li>\n<li>Object Oriented Programming with Python</li>\n<li>Experience with SciPy/NumPy and other data science libraries in Python</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ristowcapstoneproject.herokuapp.com/\">Sample website built with flask</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Database Technologies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with various SQL based databases (Postgres, MySQL, MicrosoftSQL)</li>\n<li>Experience with MongoDB NoSQL databases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JavaScript</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience working with various JavaScript libraries</li>\n<li>React</li>\n<li>Node.js</li>\n<li>D3.js</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Java</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding of Java OOP concepts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Who is Jordan Ristow?","date":"May 21, 2019","description":"Brief background about the author"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about-me-post/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Reaction to Using Gatsby.js"}},"next":null}}
