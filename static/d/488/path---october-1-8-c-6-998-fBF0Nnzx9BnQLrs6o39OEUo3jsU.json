For me, specifically, that risk came in the form of catastrophic infrastructure failure. The air conditioning system in our server building going down, a concrete slab in the middle of the runway crumbling into pieces as planes take off and land or the electrical substation overloading causing an entire installation to be without power for an extended period of time. When this is the world you are immersed in, your brain starts to view things differently from people. I am constantly weighing the benefits of one action versus another action.</p>\n<h3>What does this mean for me, Jordan?</h3>\n<p>Thats a great question. Whether in your personal life or professional, weighing the risks you are taking is a crucial aspect of thriving. Identifying the total overall risk across an entire portfolio allows us to make better informed decisions to guide our lives. I’m sure everyone has heard of the phrase, death by a thousand paper cuts. This is what can happen when total risk isn’t weighed when choosing to pursue some new initiative. Companies are littered with abandoned projects that seemed like a great idea at the time but quickly became resource drains.</p>\n<h3>Okay, but what portfolio are you talking about here?</h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, a portfolio can be considered any collection of things. Typically, in businesses, portfolios are made up of programs and projects. An example from my own life, my previous employer had an environmental portfolio which was composed of air quality and water quality management programs, as well as environmental restoration projects. In a personal life, the easiest example would be a personal finance portfolio, comprised of any income you earn, long term debt, short term debt and investments.</p>\n<h3>So, how do I apply risk management?</h3>\n<p>This can be a tricky question to answer, so I am going to do my best to simplify it down to a few basic concepts. First, never make a decision in isolation. I remember in my engineering classes we always got to work with isolated systems. It made the calculations easier </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Some Failures","date":"October 01, 2019","description":"When I landed my first management role, I was excited to"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/october-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/effective-gathering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gathering Effectively"}},"next":null}}
