Since then he has posted a series of podcasts expounding on each individual tweet (view it [here](https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich#more-28492840)). Each of these posts provided a more in depth look at what he meant. In this series of posts I will summarize what each podcast covers and write out some actionable take aways I plan on implementing from that particular conversation.*\n<p>Continuing my exploration of Naval’s thread on how to create wealth, let’s explore his thoughts on renting out your time, aka working for someone else. One of the key things he highlights about working for someone else, is that your compensation is tied directly to your inputs. Every hour you are there, you get some compensation, and no matter how much that hourly compensation is, you only earn it when you show up. Your job won’t pay you while you sleep. It won’t pay you if you take an extended leave of absence. In order to make money during times you aren’t being productive, you have to own a piece of the business. This way, anytime the company makes money, you are making money as well.</p>\n<p>Digging a little deeper into inputs vs outputs, it starts to become clear that we need to find an area where our outputs scale non-linearly from our inputs. Creating content, building a digital platform for people to use, creating other software systems. These all scale non-linearly. Your book can reach potentially millions of people, but you don’t have to do any extra work for it to go from one person to a million. This is where his point about mismatched inputs/outputs really comes into play. Even this post, could potentially reach a large audience for just an hour of my time.</p>\n<p>A final thing to highlight, he points out that when you rent out your time, you are replaceable. You may be really good at whatever your job is, but there is always someone else who would be willing to do that work. Maybe even at a cheaper price than they are paying you. So it’s really easy to get replaced when you are working for someone else.</p>\n<h3>Action Items</h3>\n<p>After reading through his post/thoughts about this, it has given me even more motivation to continue investing in companies and work on pursuing my own opportunities.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"You Won't Get Rich Renting Out Your Time -- My Thoughts","date":"August 08, 2019","description":"Holidng a regular 9-5 job is essentially renting out your time. Someone offers you some money to show up at a certain place and you do it. When you rent out your time, you limit your output based on your input. You will never generate true wealth until your outputs can non-linearly scale from your inputs. Creating new products or businesses is the only way to generate non-linear outputs."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/renting-out-your-time/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/radical-open-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making Better Decisions with a Radically Open Mind"}},"next":null}}
